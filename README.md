# basin3d
Broker for Assimilation, Synthesis and Integration of eNvironmental Diverse, Distributed Datasets. 

![basin3d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20212666/112556236-ff1a9b80-8d86-11eb-9009-25b658ce41e0.png)

BASIN-3D is a software ecosystem that synthesizes diverse earth science data from a variety of remote data sources on-demand, without the need for storing data in a single database. It is designed to parse, translate, and synthesize diverse observations from well-curated repositories into standardized formats for scientific uses such as analysis and visualization.

basin3d is the core BASIN-3D application that uses a generalized data synthesis model that applies across a variety of earth science observation types (hydrology, geochemistry, climate etc.). 

basin3d has available plugins that can connect to specific data sources of interest, and map the data source vocabularies to the basin3d synthesis models.
