Version 0.3.0
#############
This release has core improvements such as logging, error handling and data quality flag support.
The USGS plugin was enhanced to return hi resolution data from the instantaneous values
service.  The data synthesis function for getting timeseries data was moved to a
new repository (https://github.com/BASIN-3D/basin3d-views).  Simplification make for
installing development dependencies.
