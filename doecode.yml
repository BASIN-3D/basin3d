description: "BASIN-3D (Broker for Assimilation, Synthesis and Integration of eNvironmental\
  \ Diverse, Distributed Datasets) uses a data brokering approach to synthesize diverse\
  \ earth science data from a variety of remote sources in real-time without the need\
  \ for additional storage. BASIN-3D is an extendable Python application using a generalized\
  \ data synthesis model that makes the synthesized data available via Application\
  \ Programming Interface (API). We have currently implemented our data synthesis\
  \ model to represent sensor-based time series earth science observations across\
  \ a hierarchy of spatial locations. Supporting our data synthesis model is a plugin\
  \ framework that allows developers to map data sources of interest to the BASIN-3D\
  \ synthesis model."
